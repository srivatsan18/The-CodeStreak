### Definition

The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. In other words, a proxy object acts as an intermediary, allowing you to control and manage the interactions with the real object. This can be useful for various purposes such as lazy initialization, access control, logging, caching, and more.
